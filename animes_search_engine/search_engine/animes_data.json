When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her \"usual\" routine of collecting spells\nacross the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went\nthrough.\nAs the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of\nher former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans\nand create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to\nbegin.",

Sasaki saves Miyano's\nclassmate from a group of bullies, and after that, Miyano cannot seem to shake off his eccentric upperclassman. His silent\nadmiration for Sasaki gradually sours into annoyance each time the so-called delinquent refuses to leave him alone. Constantly\nbeing called by cute nicknames and having his boundaries ignored, Miyano wonders why Sasaki wants to get close to him.\nThe shy and easily flustered Miyano harbors an embarrassing secret—he is a \"fudanshi,\" a boy who likes boys' love (BL)\nmanga. The last thing he wants is for other students to find out, but through a slip of the tongue, he reveals the truth to Sasaki.\nIntrigued, the clueless Sasaki asks to borrow a book to read, which he is given very reluctantly. To Miyano's surprise, Sasaki\nenjoys the BL that he receives and asks for more, marking a shift in their strange dynamic.\nAlthough Sasaki appears to possess some personal agenda, his feelings for Miyano become complicated the more time they\nspend together. As they now share a common interest, their relationship is poised to change and further develop.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After escaping an attack and stumbling upon a decrepit village of underworld\nresidents, he begins his adventure across the different planets of this strange universe to find out more about his own identity\nand the woman he once knew.\nThrough a journey of self-discovery and acceptance, weaves together tales of souls and spirits and explores the importance of\nmemories.",

With the help of Taichi, another veteran player, and a few\nspirited newcomers, Chihaya's new-founded Mizusawa Karuta Club aims for victory in the Omi Shrine's national championship.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Taking a sip of water from one, Natsume feels a surge of energy rush throughout his body, thanks to the\n\"One Night Cup.\" It is a special cup that makes every drink delicious, but unfortunately, its effects last only for one night. The following day,\nNatsume attends the youkai banquet with his loyal protector, the sake-loving chubby cat Madara, and gets the once-in-a-lifetime\nopportunity to learn how to make sake cups.\nNatsume is filled with regret after hastily declining a rare invitation to a banquet from Madara. Curious, he chases after the cat to an old,\nrun-down mansion but soon enough feels the uncanny presence of numerous youkai nearby. When he runs into the seductive youkai\nHinoe, she explains that the empty estate serves as a hide-and-seek playground where the winning spirit acquires authority over a valley.\nWith still no trace of Madara, Natsume starts having eerie dreams of the mansion, but this time as the game's participant.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "description": "Despite being polar opposites, Makoto \"Smile\" Tsukimoto and Yutaka \"Peco\" Hoshino have been best friends since childhood.\nAlthough the overly confident Peco strives to be the best ping-pong player in the world, he often skips practice, earning the ire of\nhis fellow teammates on the Katase High School ping-pong team. Meanwhile, Smile—in spite of his innate talent for the sport—\ncannot help but hold back his full strength when playing against others. Through their mutual love for ping-pong, the two have\ndeveloped a bond that is seemingly unbreakable.\nWhen Peco hears that an ex-national team player from China is coming to Japan, he drags Smile over to rival Tsujido High\nSchool to observe them. The subsequent trip leads to a clash between Peco and Kong Wenge, who overwhelmingly defeats the\nformer in one game. Stunned by such a comprehensive loss, Peco finds himself questioning why he plays to begin with. Seeing\nhis potential as a player, Katase's coach begins to train Smile to overcome his hesitation, but he is reluctant to play if it is not for\nenjoyment.\nAs the two struggle to find meaning in the sport, a plethora of stronger players—each with their own internal strifes—await them\nat the inter-high tournament, where only the very best can persevere. But when these young athletes let their unbridled ambition\ngo unchecked, the hardships they face paint a somber reality as they pursue glory.",

That is until one night, a seemingly small event changes Dr. Tenma's life forever. While preparing to\nperform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-\nsaving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment;\nbut because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.\nSo when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan\nLiebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social\nstanding being one of them.

With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director.\nNine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to\nface with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the\none he saved.",

But when she discovers that said home is a\nrundown shrine, she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake\nher for the man Nanami rescued—the land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a\nreplacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human.\nRather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her divine duties. But if she must keep things running\nsmoothly, she will need the help of a certain hot-headed fox. In her fumbling attempt to seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and\nends up sealing a contract with him.

The few who share his hobby might recognize him by his in-game\nname, Sunraku. For his next game, Rakurou is recommended Shangri-La Frontier, a popular and well-received virtual reality\ngame as a breather from the terrible games he has been playing recently.\nOnce he boots up the game, Rakurou decides to sell off most of his starting gear to gain extra money, leaving himself with only a\npair of boxers, a bird mask, and some weapons. He is instantly hooked as he meticulously levels up his avatar. However, after\nencountering some intimidating monsters, he realizes that he may have underestimated the challenge that a mainstream game\ncan offer. As Rakurou progresses, he must draw on all the skills he has perfected from his previous gaming experience. Before\nlong, Sunraku's eccentric playstyle takes Shangri-La Frontier by storm.",

A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang's cruel murder of\nthe only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for\ngood, Takemichi flashes back to that same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.\nAfter being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata's younger brother.\nWithout thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi urges him to protect his sister\nbefore inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he is not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though\nTakemichi can alter the flow of time. Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend's tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji\nGang, Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.",

Feeling\nuncomfortable, Kou only pretends to doze off—which is when Nazuna suddenly bites his neck, revealing herself to be a vampire!\nWhile Kou thinks the bite will turn him into a vampire, the specifics of transforming are not that simple. In order to change, he\nmust be bitten by someone he truly loves.

Left to the whims of his captors after his managers refuse to pay his ransom, Rokurou does the unthinkable:\ninstead of begging for his life, he joins the very crew who kidnapped him.\nNow a member of the group, Rokurou must adjust to his new residence in the dissolute hellscape known as Roanapur, a city\nwhere corruption and crime run rampant, and even the smallest slipup could cost him his life.

        "description": "With a cartload of fur pelts in tow, traveling merchant Kraft Lawrence stops by the village of Pasloe. According to local folklore,\ncenturies ago, one of the villagers made a promise with the wolf deity Holo, who swore to bless Pasloe with bountiful harvests of\nwheat. Yet, as time passed, such stories became little more than relics of the past.\nAfter quickly finishing his business in the village, Lawrence sets out to his next destination. His journey, however, takes an\nunexpected turn when he discovers a nude, animal-eared girl sleeping among his pelts. Even more surprisingly, the youthful-\nlooking woman claims to be Holo—the wolf of legend.\nHolo wishes to return to her hometown in the north, and though their first encounter is rocky, she convinces Lawrence to\naccompany her on her travels. In return, she vows to earn her keep, using her quick wits and lifetime of experience to help her\nnewfound companion in his dealings. As they continue their journey, Lawrence and Holo take advantage of whatever economic\nopportunities they come across, often landing in situations that put both their business skills and their relationship to the test.",
